# GO Weather App
Weather application using fyne.io

I wanted to create this project once I finished a [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-programming-golang-the-complete-developers-guide/) on Go to improve my skills.

## PREREQUISITES

You must have your [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/price) api key, I used the free one.

## HOW TO INSTALL AND USE

You have to *clone* the repo and after that, in the root of the project, type the command `go mod tidy` to install all the dependencies.
Next, also in the root directory you have to create an ***.env*** file where you save your *api key* in this format: 
`API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
